1. Introduction  
Welcome to the CampaignX API! This high -performance API allows you to programmatically manage 
your marketing campaigns. You can retrieve customer cohorts, submit new campaigns, and fetch 
detailed reports.  
Our API is built around RESTful principles and returns JSON responses. This document provides all 
the necessary information to integrate with CampaignX successfully.  
Base URL:  https://campaignx.inxiteout.ai  
API Version:  1.0 
Documentation Version:  1.0 
2. Getting Started  
2.1. Authentication & API Keys  
To interact with the CampaignX API, you must authenticate all your requests (except for the signup 
endpoint) using an API key.  
• How to obtain an API Key:  You will receive your unique API key upon successful registration 
via the  /api/v1/signup  endpoint.  Store this key securely, as it is shown only once.  
• How to use it:  The API key must be included in the  X-API-Key header of every request.  
Example Header:  
X-API-Key: xK8mP3nR7sT9vW2yZ5bN4mQ6jL1hG0fD  
2.2. Rate Limiting  
To ensure fair usage and system stability, the API enforces rate limits based on your API key.  
• Limit:  100 requests per day.  
• Scope:  This limit applies to all authenticated endpoints (e.g., getting cohorts, sending 
campaigns, fetching reports).  
• Monitoring:  Exceeding this limit will result in a  429 Too Many Requests  response.  
2.3. Making Requests & Handling Responses  
• Request Format:  For POST  requests, the request body must be sent in JSON format with 
the Content -Type: application/json  header.  
• Response Format:  All successful responses (2xx status codes) will be in JSON format.  
• Error Handling:  API errors will return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 4xx for client 
errors, 5xx for server errors) along with a JSON body containing details about the error. Refer 
to the  Error Handling  section for more information.

4. Error Handling  
The CampaignX API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an 
API request. In general, codes in the  2xx range indicate success, codes in the  4xx range indicate an 
error that resulted from the provided information (e.g., a  required parameter was missing, a 
validation failed), and codes in the  5xx range indicate an error with CampaignX's servers.  
When a  4xx or 5xx error occurs, the response body will contain a JSON object describing the error, 
typically a  ValidationError  or HTTPValidationError.  
Common Error Codes:  
Status Code  Title  Description  
400 Bad Request  The request was malformed or contains invalid parameters.  
401 Unauthorized  Missing or invalid API key. Ensure your  X-API-Key header is set correctly.  
403 Forbidden  The API key is valid but does not have permission to access the resource.  
404 Not Found  The requested resource (e.g., a campaign or endpoint) was not found.  
422 Unprocessable 
Entity  The request body or parameters were well -formed but contain semantic 
errors (e.g., a customer ID in the list does not exist, or a field failed 
validation). The response body will detail the specific errors.  
429 Too Many Requests  You have exceeded your rate limit of 100 requests per day.  
5xx Server Error  An internal server error occurred. Please contact support if the problem 
persists.
